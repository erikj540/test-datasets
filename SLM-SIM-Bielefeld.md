## Datasets from a home-built SLM-SIM in the Biophotonics group, Bielefeld

This dataset was acquired in a very early state of testing our SLM-SIM setup. Thus, modulation depth and resolution improvement are far from optimal.

###Glass surface with 200nm Tetraspeck(TM) beads
excitation at 643nm,
emission at approx. 680nm
