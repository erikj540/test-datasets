# fairSIM test datasets

Example datasets from various SR-SIM microscopy platforms.

For each microscope, a file in this repository lists all available datasets,
with links to the raw data hosted on github and mirrored on our institue website.

If you can provide additional datasets, especially from further microscopy platforms 
(home-built setups and or e.g. the Nikon SIM), we would be very happy to include them here.
